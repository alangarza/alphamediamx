         <p class="legal"><strong>1. Content of online offering<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></strong>The author assumes no warranty whatsoever for the current status, correctness, completeness or quality of the information made available. Any claims for liability against the author relating to loss or damage of a material or sentimental value caused by the use or non-use of the information made available or through the use of incorrect and incomplete information shall be ruled out on principle in the absence of any evidence of intent or gross negligence on the part of the author. All offers are without engagement and non-binding in nature. The author explicitly reserves the right to modify, supplement or delete parts of the pages or the entire offering or to discontinue its publication temporarily or permanently, without any separate announcement being necessary to this end.<br><br><strong>2. Referrals and links<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></strong>In the case of direct or indirect references to outside websites (“hyperlinks”) beyond the scope of responsibility of the author, any obligation to accept liability shall solely enter into force in the event that the author has knowledge of the content thereof, and it would be technically feasible and reasonable to prevent utilisation of unlawful content. The author hereby explicitly declares that, at the time of link implementation, no illegal contents were discernible on the pages to be linked. The author has no influence whatsoever on the current and future design, content or authorship/copyright of linked/connected pages. The author therefore hereby expressly dissociates himself from all contents of any linked/connected pages that have been changed subsequent to link implementation. The foregoing statement shall apply to all links and references implemented as part of the offering on the Internet, as well as outside entries in the guest books, discussion forums, link directories, mailing lists and any other forms of databases set up by the author to the contents of which external write access is possible. The party providing pages to which references/links were made shall bear sole responsibility for illegal, incorrect or incomplete contents and in particular damages that may arise from the use or non-use of information presented in such a manner, and not the party merely referring to the respective publication in question by way of links.<br><br><strong>3.Copyright and trademark rights<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></strong>The author undertakes to make an effort to observe any copyright to the images, graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts used, to use images, graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts created himself or to have access to licence-free graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts. All brand names and labels indicated within the scope of the Internet presence and possibly protected by third parties are subject – without limitation – to the labelling laws in force from time to time and to the rights of possession of the respective owners registered. The mere mention alone cannot lead to the conclusion that trademarks are not protected by rights of third parties! The copyright for objects published and created by the author himself shall remain exclusively with the author of the pages. Any copying or use of such graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts in other electronic or printed publications is not allowed without the express consent of the author.<br><br><strong>4. Data protection<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></strong>In the event that the Internet offering provides a function for entry of personal or business data (e-mail addresses, names, physical or postal addresses), the disclosure of such data is made by the user on an explicitly voluntary basis. The utilisation of, and payment for, all services offered – to the extent that this is technically feasible and acceptable – is also allowed without the disclosure of such data or using anonymised data or a pseudonym. The use of the data within the scope of the publishing information or comparable disclosures of contact data published, such as postal addresses, telephone and fax numbers as well as e-mail addresses by third parties to send information that was not explicitly requested is prohibited. Legal steps against senders of spam mails are explicitly reserved in the event of any violations of this prohibition.<br><br><strong>5. Legal effectiveness of this disclaimer<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></strong>This disclaimer is to be considered part of the Internet offering from which the referral was made to this particular page. Should any parts or specific wording of this text not (or no longer, or not fully) be in compliance with the current legal situation, this shall not affect the remaining sections of the document in terms of its content and validity.</p>
